<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>It's good to have you here :)</p>
<p>This is a website I'm building to teach myself templating and a more holistic style of webdev, from scratch.</p>
<p>Right now, it's also a signpost for <a href="/info.html">ways to find me</a> while I'm working on a whole new version of this thing.</p>

<p>Poke around if you like :)</p>
